 Official CLI for [Deepgram](https://www.deepgram.com/). Start building with our powerful transcription & speech understanding API.

> This project is currently ALPHA and is in active development. Commands are likely to change without warning or deprecation.
## Getting an API Key

ðŸ”‘ To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

## Documentation

 The Deepgram CLI can be used to interact with the [Deepgram API](https://developers.deepgram.com/api-reference/) from the command line. It is built using [oclif](https://oclif.io/).

# Writing Templates

The Deepgram CLI can **_generate_** from any public repository, with a small amount of configuration in a `deepgram.toml`.

```toml
# command properties
[build]
  command = "your build command" # required
  args = ["--arg=one", "--arg=two"]

# config properties
[config]
  sample = "sample-config-file" # required
  output = "config-file" # required

# post-build properties
[post-build]
  message = "final message to output to instruct users to start your app"
```

Check out this [`deepgram.toml`](https://github.com/deepgram-templates/video-chat/blob/main/deepgram.toml) from our video-chat template.

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install"

[config]
  sample = ".env-sample"
  output = ".env"

[post-build]
  message = "Run `npm start` to get up and running."
```

Config is generated by replacing template-strings in the [sample config](https://github.com/deepgram-templates/video-chat/blob/main/.env-sample), whether it's an **_API Key_** or a **_Project ID_**

In this sample, we'll replace `%api_key%` with the API configured when you set up the CLI.

```env
port=3000
deepgram_api_key=%api_key%
```
